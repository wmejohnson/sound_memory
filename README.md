## sound_memory
read arbitrary memory and write it to a wav file. should work on linux systems with sudo no problem. thought, for some reason on my system it doesn't work with files longer than 20 seconds. 

see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114319/how-to-access-dev-mem-in-osx about making it work on osx. haven't tested it out myself yet, but will do soon. 

### Options:
-l: length in seconds (default: 3)

-o: outfile name (include .wav)

-b: bit depth (currently not working)

-h: help
